<h1><u> The Dog </u>
<center>
<p style = "font-size:60%">
The domestic dog <span style="color:cyan">(Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)</span> is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,[5][6] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[7] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[8][7] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[6] before the development of agriculture.[1] Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior,[9] leading to a large number of domestic individuals and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
